What technologies lead to better remote opportunities and higher salaries?

# Tools I Used

- **PostgreSQL** – for writing and executing complex SQL queries.

- **Visual Studio Code** – my code editor of choice for development and query building.

- **Git** – for version control and project management.

- **GitHub** – to share, collaborate, and showcase my project.
